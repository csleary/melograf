  <h1>Welcome to Melograf</h1>
  <p>Celebrating ten years of mastering, 2009&ndash;2019!</p>
  <p>
    Created for the emergent class of DIY musicians and indie labels, Melograf provides the means to
    give every release the final sheen, balance and punch needed to sound its best, at
    <a href="#rates">indie-friendly prices</a>. We proudly offer a tailored experience, striving to
    meet the needs of a variety of artists and labels, across a spectrum of musical genres and
    styles.
  </p>
  <h1>Hybrid Mastering</h1>
  <p>
    With rates from as little as &euro;25 per track, there's no reason why your next release can't
    be given an extra polish. As an unattended mastering service with online file transfers, it
    doesn't matter where you're working from&mdash;your music can benefit from an objective ear,
    along with world-class analogue outboard equipment and digital processing.

  <h1 id="rates">Rates</h1>
  <p>
    I work to a scaled system, depending on the number of tracks to be mastered. It is more
    cost-effective to have multiple tracks mastered in a single session, than to have single tracks
    mastered periodically.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>First track: &euro;45 EUR</li>
    <li>2nd&ndash;4th tracks: &euro;35 per track</li>
    <li>5th+ tracks: &euro;25 per track</li>
    <li>
      Extra versions/edits/instrumentals are mastered at a reduced rate of &euro;10 per track (when
      included with original track)
    </li>
    <li>An optional &euro;50 charged for a DDP image</li>
    <li>Total amount subject to VAT of 21% inside the EU (unless you have a VAT number)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Accepted methods of payment are credit/debit card (via Stripe), PayPal, and bank transfer. You
    will receive a pdf invoice via email, detailing how to conveniently and quickly pay before
    receiving your masters.
