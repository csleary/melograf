  <h1>Preparation</h1>
  <p>
    Before you make delivery arrangements, please ensure the original file is at
    the very least a 44.1kHz/16-bit stereo .wav or .aif recording (24-bit is
    preferred and strongly recommended) and that no dynamic compression or
    limiting has been applied to the stereo mix for the sake of loudness (don't
    worry if you mix through a bus compressor, that's fine). It is very
    difficult to restore the punch and transient attack of your material if it
    has already been severely brickwalled, so please refrain from limiting (or
    worse, clipping) your mixes before delivery, and ideally leave at least
    2-3dB of headroom in your mixdowns.
  </p>
  <p>
    Compressing the file using
    <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/">FLAC</a> will ensure greatly
    decreased transfer times compared to simply zipping up the uncompressed
    source files. FLAC is a free, lossless compression format, providing
    bit-for-bit identical decodings of the source material, compressing up to
    half the size of the source files. Strongly recommended.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have a particular sound in mind you'd like me to aim for, then please
    feel free to include some reference material (high-quality mp3s would be
    ideal for this) or some guidelines detailing a desired aesthetic (e.g. I
    want this to sound warmer, tame the high-end etc.) otherwise I will proceed
    at my own discretion. Likewise, if you require track gaps or
    fades/crossfades of a particular duration, please also include these in the
    notes, otherwise I'll go by ear.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please include any <abbr title="Universal Product Code">UPC</abbr>/<abbr
      title="European Article Number"
      >EAN</abbr
    >
    or <abbr title="International Standard Recording Code">ISRC</abbr> codes you
    may have for your album, as well as any CD-Text or wav metadata that you'd
    like embedding.
  </p>
  <p>
    Single track turnaround times are typically within 48 hours of reception
    (sometimes within 24 hours, schedule permitting!).
  </p>
  <h1>Transfer</h1>
  <p>
    Please use <a href="https://www.wetransfer.com/">WeTransfer</a> to transfer
    your tracks for mastering, quickly and securely.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default I will supply a 44.1kHz/16-bit stereo .wav; if you require a
    different format, or want a master audio CD posted to you, please state when
    enquiring.

  <h1>Processing</h1>
  <p>
    Software processing is carried out using a variety of carefully chosen tools
    from leaders in the field.
  </p>
  <p>
    Analogue processing includes an API 5500 EQ (with Scott Lieber Red Dot Op
    Amps) and a Foote Control Systems P3S ME Class A compressor.
  </p>
  <p>
    Monitoring and signal conversion are deftly handled by Klein + Hummel and
    Mytek respectively, providing exceptional clarity and very low distortion. A
    rock-solid RME HDSPe AES-32 card is used for digital interfacing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once mastering is complete, and all the tracks have been trimmed and faded
    as necessary, you will receive a zip of test mp3s for you to evaluate before
    proceeding with payment. On receipt of payment, I will upload the final
    masters, whether in wav or DDP format, and will post any CDs.
