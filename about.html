  <h1>About Melograf</h1>
  <p>
    Melograf Mastering is operated by engineer Christopher Leary. A keen
    musician, Leary has been writing and producing
    <a href="http://ochremusic.com/">music</a> since the late nineties,
    developing a reputation for pristine production and attention to detail.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since 2007, he has mastered over 700 projects for independent labels and
    artists. A handful of his growing mastering credits can be seen on
    <a
      href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Christopher+Leary#t=Credits_Technical"
      >Discogs.com</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enjoying the combination of objective technical precision and creative
    musical shaping that the mastering process affords, Leary decided to launch
    a mastering business in earnest, establishing Melograf Mastering in the late
    summer of 2009.
